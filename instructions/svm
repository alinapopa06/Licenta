We are given a training dataset of n {\displaystyle n} n points of the form (x1 ,y1),…,(xn, yn), where the yi are either 1 or −1, each indicating the class to which the point xi belongs. Each xi is a p-dimensional real vector. We want to find the "maximum-margin hyperplane" that divides the group of points xi for which yi = 1 from the group of points for which yi = − 1 , which is defined so that the distance between the hyperplane and the nearest point xi from either group is maximize. Any hyperplane can be written as the set of points x satisfying w^T x − b = 0, where w is the (not necessarily normalized) normal vector to the hyperplane. This is much like Hesse normal form, except that w is not necessarily a unit vector. The parameter b / ||w|| determines the offset of the hyperplane from the origin along the normal vector w.
