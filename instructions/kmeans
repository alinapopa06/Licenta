The algorithm works as follows: first we initialize k points, called means, randomly. We categorize each item to its closest mean and we update the meanâ€™s coordinates, which are the averages of the items categorized in that mean so far. We repeat the process for a given number of iterations and at the end, we have our clusters. The "points" mentioned above are called means, because they hold the mean values of the items categorized in it. To initialize these means, we have a lot of options. An intuitive method is to initialize the means at random items in the data set. Another method is to initialize the means at random values between the boundaries of the data set (if for a feature x the items have values in [0,3], we will initialize the means with values for x at [0,3]).
